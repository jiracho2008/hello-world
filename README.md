# hello-world
This is my first Repository. Time to rock!
Hi there My name is jiracho2008! I am fairly new to programming. I have studied the last 3 weeks every single day on HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and PHP. I can create blog pages in khanacadamy and now I want to test my skills with another platform. I hope to meet some new coding friends while being on here!
